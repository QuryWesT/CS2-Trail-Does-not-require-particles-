The purpose of this plugin is to create a trail effect behind the player using specific codes. The best part is that it does not require any effects, particles, or models. It works by using the game’s built-in color codes, providing an FPS-friendly and fun experience. Additionally, you can easily add or remove new colors through the configuration file.
